      <div class="about-grid">
        <div class="about-card card-1">
          I’ve always been drawn to technology — not just using it, but understanding how it works. Whether it’s editing a short film or setting up the latest piece of gear, I love learning by doing.
        </div>
        <div class="about-card card-2">
          I studied film at university, focusing mostly on post-production and editing. Over time, I became more curious about the tech behind the tools I was using — how they worked, how they were built, and how they could be improved. That curiosity eventually led me toward web development, where I found a new kind of creative problem-solving that really clicked.
        </div>
        <div class="about-card card-3">
          I enjoy exploring how things come together — in code, in design, and in everyday tools. I’m especially interested in tech that helps people create or connect in new ways.
        </div>
        <div class="about-card card-4">
          I spend a lot of my downtime watching films (usually overanalysing them), working out, or doing the occasional bouldering session. I’m into anything that’s hands-on, a little challenging, and a good time.
