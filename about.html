        <div class="about-card card-1">
          I’ve always been into tech, not just using it but figuring out how it all works. Whether I’m editing a short film or setting up some new gear, I enjoy learning by diving in.
        </div>
        <div class="about-card card-2">
          I studied film at uni, mostly focusing on editing and post-production. Over time, I got more interested in the tech behind the tools I was using, wondering how they worked and how they could be better. That curiosity led me into web development, and I found a new kind of creative problem-solving that really stuck.
        </div>
        <div class="about-card card-3">
          I like figuring out how things fit together, whether it's code, design, or everyday tools. I'm especially drawn to tech that helps people create or connect in cool ways.
        </div>
        <div class="about-card card-4">
          In my downtime, I’m usually watching movies (and probably overthinking them), working out, or doing a bit of bouldering. I’m into anything that’s hands-on, a bit challenging, and actually fun.
